# SEPIA Control HUB
The SEPIA Control HUB (formerly known as 'Admin Tools') is a web-application that contains a collection of tools to help you set up your SEPIA servers remotely, create users, configure your smart home connector, edit settings and test things. 
The Code-UI to create, download and register custom smart-services and Mesh-Node plugins is part of the control HUB as well.  
  
If you've installed SEPIA using the [SEPIA-Home bundle](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-installation-and-setup/releases) you should be able to access the HUB from your network, via:  
* https://[my-domain]/sepia/assist/tools/index.html  
* http://[my-server-IP-or-host-address]:20721/tools/index.html  

Or you can check-out the officially hosted version:  
* https://sepia-framework.github.io/tools/index.html
